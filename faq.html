It is important for this research to get information from as many people who live together as soon as possible after a person has a positive COVID test.

          <p>The study will last about 4-6weeks. Completing screening, consent and enrollment into the study will take approximately 30 minutes. Each day you collect a COVID-19 test sample and answer questions on the study website will take 15-20 minutes. On the first day of sample collection, we also will ask you to collect a few drops of blood from your arm using a special device. This should take just about 5 minutes. At the end of 10 days, we will ask you to complete a few questions on the 10th day of the collection period. These questions will take about 10 minutes. Approximately 4 weeks after starting the study, you will be asked to collect a few more drops of blood from your arm using the same special device and complete a final set of questions. This will take 10-15 minutes. </p>

If several of your household contacts do not agree to be in the study within 1 to 3 days of the test date of the household contact who was COVID-19 positive, your household may not be eligible for the study. The exact timing depends on whether the person who was COVID-19 positive had symptoms and when they began.</p>

          <p>After you complete the screener questions and agree to be in the study, we will reach out to your household contacts to see if they are interested in being in the study too. If the majority of your household agrees to be in the study, everyone will need to complete the enrollment questions. You and the people you live with will be asked questions about yourself, your health and exposure to COVID-19. We will also ask if you have been vaccinated for COVID-19 and ask you to provide details about vaccinations (such as when and where you were vaccinated). These questions will be on the study website. </p>
          <p>You will be asked to collect a COVID-19 test sample every day (by a swab in your nose or saliva sample) for 10 days in a row. You also will be asked to answer a few questions everyday on the study website about how you are feeling, if you took any medications and how much time you were around the people in your household. On the first day, we also will ask you to put a special device on your arm to collect a few of drops of blood for testing. You will need to ship the test kits to a laboratory for testing for COVID-19. It will take 15-20 minutes to complete the test and answer the questions every day. About 4 weeks later, we will ask you to use the special device on your arm again to collect a few drops of blood for testing and mail in the sample. We will also ask a few questions on the study website about the people you live with and if you saw a doctor or other healthcare worker during the study. We also ask permission for the study to keep these samples for future research. </p>

          <p>Other than required reporting of positive COVID-19 results, we will share information that you give us for the study only with other study researchers, and those records will not contain your name or other information that could identify you. However, if you give the Point of Contact for the household permission to access your study information, they will see all your answers.</p>

          <p>This research study has a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Unless you say it is okay, study staff cannot release information that may identify you for a legal action, a lawsuit, or as evidence. This protection applies to requests from federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. As an example, the Certificate would protect your information from a court subpoena.</p>

          <p>There are some important things that you need to know. The Certificate DOES NOT protect your information if a federal, state, or local law says it must be reported. For example, some laws require reporting of abuse, communicable diseases, and threats of harm to yourself or others. The Certificate CANNOT BE USED to stop a federal or state government agency from checking records or evaluating programs. The Certificate DOES NOT stop reporting required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Certificate also DOES NOT stop your information from being used for other studies if allowed by federal regulations.</p>

          <p>Study staff may release your information when you say it is okay. For example, you may give them permission to release information to insurers, your doctors, or any other person not connected with the study. The Certificate of Confidentiality does not stop you from releasing your own information. It also does not stop you from getting copies of your own information.</p>
