People who just received a test result that shows they have COVID-19 (also known as a positive test) and the people that they live with, are being asked to be in this research study. The study will last about six weeks.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sponsoring the study.

          <p class="small pl-5 pr-5">All of the questions and forms to complete are on the study website. We want everyone you live with to be in the study if possible. The study will start when most of the people you live with agree to do the study. Once you agree to be a part of the study, you will be asked to create an account.  Everyone will create an account and use it to log into the website.</p>

At the end of 10 days, we will ask you to complete a few questions on the 10th day of the collection period. These questions will take about 10 minutes. Approximately 4 weeks after starting the study, you will be asked to collect a few more drops of blood from your arm using the same special device and complete a final set of questions. This will take 10-15 minutes. </p>

On the first day, we also will ask you to put a special device on your arm to collect a few of drops of blood for testing. You will need to ship the test kits to a laboratory for testing for COVID-19. It will take 15-20 minutes to complete the test and answer the questions every day.

Unless you say it is okay, study staff cannot release information that may identify you for a legal action, a lawsuit, or as evidence.

For example, some laws require reporting of abuse, communicable diseases, and threats of harm to yourself or others. The Certificate CANNOT BE USED to stop a federal or state government agency from checking records or evaluating programs. The Certificate DOES NOT stop reporting required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Certificate also DOES NOT stop your information from being used for other studies if allowed by federal regulations.</p>

                <p>Study staff may release your information when you say it is okay. For example, you may give them permission to release information to insurers, your doctors, or any other person not connected with the study. The Certificate of Confidentiality does not stop you from releasing your own information. It also does not stop you from getting copies of your own information.</p>
